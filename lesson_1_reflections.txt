How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It severely limited the lines shown, making the difference easy to see.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps you find changes faster, which will help you find bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Choosing to make a commit will limit commits, but a change may be missed if commit is 
	not done.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is a version control for programming languages. Files for programming language have
	a relation and must be saved together. The files saved in Google Docs do not have that
	relationship.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log helps you find the commit and git diff helps you compare the commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can easily change between commits to find errors and use git diff to find the change.
	Then you can make the bug fix.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Software development
