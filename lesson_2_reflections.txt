What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository, you add git meta data files to that directory.
	You do this so that you can start tracking file versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a place where files can be added in preparation to be commited
	to the repository. The staging area helps to arrange files in order to include them
	in the commit.
