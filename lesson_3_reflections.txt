When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to collaborate with others, or make the files available to
	your other devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may make a lot of commits locally and only want to commit every so 
	often to GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Use a fork when you want a copy of the GitHub repository but do not have
	save permission to the original repository. Clone is to save the repository
	on your computer. You can fork someone elses repository and then clone it.
	If you want different versions of the files, then you can branch the
	repository. Branch if you want to use different languages for the files.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This makes it easy to compare file changes and commit history. This will
	make is easier to merge files if there is a big delta.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would use another versioning control system that is not open to the public.
	It would be the same except it wouldn't be free.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Changes to master should only be done after all merges have been resolved
	on a local computer. Otherwise, changes should be tested on another branch.
